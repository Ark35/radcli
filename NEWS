* Version 1.2.0 (unreleased)
- Initial version of the fork. That changes the name of the library to
  libradcli.so, and the header to radcli.h. A compatibility header with
  freeradius-client library is also installed.
- Adds support for TLS (RFC6614) and DTLS (RFC7360) without
  requiring any code changes for existing applications. It adds
  new configuration options: serv-auth-type, tls-ca-file,
  tls-key-file, tls-cert-file, tls-verify-hostname.
- Removed the requirement for legacy options to be present in the configuration
  file. That includes: auth_order, login_tries, login_timeout, nologin, issue,
  login_radius, seqfile
