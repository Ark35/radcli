# defined they are tried in a round robin fashion if one
# server is not answering.

# RADIUS listens separated by a colon from the hostname. if
# no port is specified /etc/services is consulted of the radius
# service. if this fails also a compiled in default is used.

# The length of time in seconds that we skip a nonresponsive RADIUS
# server for transaction requests.  Server(s) being in the "dead" state
# are tried only after all other non-dead servers have been tried and
# failed or timeouted.  The deadtime interval starts when the server
# does not respond to an authentication/accounting request transmissions. 
# When the interval expires, the "dead" server would be re-tried again,
# and if it's still down then it will be considered "dead" for another
# such interval and so on. This option is no-op if there is only one
# server in the list. Set to 0 in order to disable the feature.
