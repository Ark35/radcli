The radcli library
==================

1. INTRODUCTION
---------------
The radcli library is a library for writing RADIUS Clients. The library's
approach is to allow writing RADIUS-aware application in less than 50 lines
of C code. It was based originally on freeradius-client and is source
compatible with it.

It is highly portable and runs on Linux, many BSD variants and Solaris.
